# D3 Labs - 0243791
This repo was created to prove and deliver labs for my Graphic Simulation class. 

## Requirements To use
- Chrome web browser or similar.
- Python 3.6+

## How to run 
In MacOs
```Python
python3 -m http.server
```
In Windows
```Python
python -m http.server
```
Once is up and running, we should see something like this on the console:
```
Serving HTTP on :: port 8000 (http://[::]:8000/) ... 
```
This will open up a server at port 8000. you can enter on your browser by typing in **http://localhost:8000**.
To Stop the server from running, go to the terminal and inside of it press **CONTROL + C**
